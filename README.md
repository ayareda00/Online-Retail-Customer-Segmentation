# 🎯 Pattern Recognition in Speech and Signal Analysis

This project demonstrates how to analyze and recognize patterns in digital signals or speech using Python. It focuses on extracting meaningful features, estimating time delays, and visualizing key behaviors in signal data.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Cross-correlation** for delay estimation
- **Energy-based analysis** of signals
- **Signal visualization** using Matplotlib
- **Synthetic signal generation** for testing patterns

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

## 📁 File

- `finalpattern.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing code, explanations, and visualizations.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pattern-recognition.git
